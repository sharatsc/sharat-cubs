[oimg,fimg,bwimg,eimg,enhimg] =  fft_enhance_cubs(imread('1_1.tif'));
%oimg -  [OUT] block orientation image(can be viewed using view_orientation_image.m)
%fimg  - [OUT] block frequency image(indicates ridge spacing)
%bwimg - [OUT] shows angular bandwidth image(filter bandwidth adapts near the singular points)
%eimg  - [OUT] energy image. Indicates the 'ridgeness' of a block (can be used for fingerprint segmentation)
%enhimg- [OUT] enhanced image
%img   - [IN]  input fingerprint image (HAS to be of DOUBLE type)
